Jorge noted that each of these scripts references snakemake. This was part of the course
he took. If I wanted to use this with standalone files, I would just have to replace any
reference to snakemake with the files I want to reference.
Also, get_pdb_ids.py will not work because it uses an old method of scraping PDB ID's that
has been deprecated.
