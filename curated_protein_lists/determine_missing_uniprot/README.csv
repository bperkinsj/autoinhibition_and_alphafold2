This folder contains two lists of uniprot IDs, one taken from the curated master list of autoinhibited proteins and one from the list of those proteins that exist in the
Deepmind Alphafold database. There is also a script that determines which Uniprot IDs are missing from the AlphaFold list, as there are only 442 in that list as 
compared to the 454 in the curated master list.
