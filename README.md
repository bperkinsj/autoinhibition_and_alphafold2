# autoinhibition_and_alphafold2
This is my first project in my Masters. This aims to evaluate the performance of AlphaFold2 on autoinhibitory interfaces in proteins exhibiting autoinhibitory functionality.

Please note that pdb file 7w39 was manually removed due to file size limitations when converting from mmcif to pdb. In addition, 3vd8 and 2vgq were removed for being chimeric proteins that did not contain one of the inhibitory regions for the desired protein.
For every pdb file with NMR as the method of collection, the first model was chosen for rmsd calculations.
