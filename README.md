# autoinhibition_and_alphafold2
This is my first project in my Masters. This aims to evaluate the performance of AlphaFold2 on autoinhibitory interfaces in proteins exhibiting autoinhibitory functionality.
Please note that all files containing protein structural data exist in a folder parent to this one, and only on my workspace in the Gsponer lab, to avoid uneccessarily large data uploads to Github or other locations.
