Its autoinhibition is mediated by an intramolecular interaction between beta-sheet (beta1' and beta2') and DFG helix in A-loop. ALK releases autoinhibited conformation by packing N-terminal β-sheet the C-terminal end of the αC helix. It is suggested that two phosphorylated tyrosines (Tyr1096 and Tyr1278) prevents ALKs from returning to their positions in the autoinhibited conformation.,Inferred by structure analysis without experimental evidences,,,
,,,P55957,,,,,,,,BH3-interacting domain death agonist (p22 BID) (BID) [Cleaved into: BH3-interacting domain death agonist p15 (p15 BID); BH3-interacting domain death agonist p13 (p13 BID); BH3-interacting domain death agonist p11 (p11 BID)],BID,195,Homo sapiens (Human),14-41(N-terminal autoinhibitory region),10089877,BID is a proapoptotic member of the BCL2 family that shares only the BH3 domain homology with other members of the family in its amino acid sequence. The N-terminal segment may serve as an internal inhibitor of proapoptotic activity. The proapoptotic activity of BID is expected to require dissociaqtion of the N-terminal segment including H1(14-29) and H2(33-41).,Inferred by structure analysis without experimental evidences,,,
