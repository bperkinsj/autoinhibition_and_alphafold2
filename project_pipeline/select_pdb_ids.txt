This file contains the code to go in the select_pdb_ids function in aa_parser.py. I keep it in this .txt file as a reference whenever I merge my branch with the Fred62879proteinFold
main because this is the only thing I need to change (besides the config file).


pdb_ids = []

    with open(join(config['data_dir'], 'proteins_pdb_best.tsv')) as pdb_file:
        reader = csv.DictReader(pdb_file, delimiter='\t')
        for row in reader:
            pdb_ids.append(row['PDB ID'])


    config['pdb_ids'] = pdb_ids
    print(f'selected proteins {pdb_ids}')
